# Future-Driven-Ad-Spending-Analysis
Project Overview  
This project focuses on applying nonlinear regression models to analyze the strategic planning behind Gillette's advertising expenditures. By estimating the coefficients of long-term margin (A) and sales multiple (B) — both functions of the acquisition probability (theta) — we investigate whether these expenditures were potentially influenced by considerations of future acquisitions.  

Features  
Nonlinear Regression Models: Utilizes nonlinear regression to model the relationship between advertising expenditures and financial metrics under different scenarios of acquisition probability.  
Monte Carlo Simulations: Employs Monte Carlo methods to generate 1000 simulations, providing a robust estimation of 95% confidence intervals for the regression coefficients.  
Reproducibility: Ensures reproducibility of results by setting a random seed, enabling precise replication of the simulation process.
Strategic Analysis: Investigates the strategic implications behind advertising decisions, particularly examining if there was a foresight of potential acquisitions factored into these expenditures.  

Purpose  
The goal of this project is to understand the intricacies of advertising budget allocation in relation to company growth strategies and market positioning. By determining if and how Gillette's management incorporated future acquisition considerations into their advertising spend, we offer insights into effective financial and marketing planning.
